✅ Project Abstract

The Stock Management System is a simple C-based application designed to manage inventory efficiently. The main goal of the project is to provide a basic computerized system that helps store, update, search, and display stock items.

The system allows the user to add new items with details such as item ID, name, quantity, and price. It also provides options to update stock levels when items are sold or added. Users can search for specific items and view the complete list of available stock.

This project demonstrates the use of structures, arrays, loops, conditional statements, and string functions in C programming. It is suitable for beginners and helps understand how real-life inventory systems work.
